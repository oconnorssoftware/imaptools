# imaptools
A script for parsing inbound emails from a given account using IMAP.  Attachments from emails are also downloaded and saved.

To run
create a file called mailcreds.json with "username" and "password" both as keys to the credentials of the mail account you would like to use and place it relative to this script.  Then you may run the script.

NOTE: Attatchements you download could potentially be malicious so work at your own risk
NOTE: If you are using a gmail account you may have to turn on "Allow less secure apps" in the settings.
